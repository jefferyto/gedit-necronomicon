# Necronomicon, a plugin for gedit #

Reopen recently-closed files ("undo close tab")  
<https://github.com/jefferyto/gedit-necronomicon>  
v0.1.0

All bug reports, feature requests and miscellaneous comments are welcome
at the [project issue tracker][].

## Requirements ##

Tested with gedit 3.6, though earlier versions of gedit 3 should also be
compatible.

## Installation ##

1.  Download the source code (as [zip][] or [tar.gz][]) and extract.
2.  Copy `necronomicon.py` and the appropriate `.plugin` file into
    `~/.local/share/gedit/plugins` (create if it does not exist):
    *   For gedit 3.6 and earlier, copy `necronomicon.plugin.python2`
        and rename to `necronomicon.plugin`.
    *   For gedit 3.8 and later, copy `necronomicon.plugin`.
3.  Restart gedit, select **Edit > Preferences** (or
    **gedit > Preferences** on Mac), and enable the plugin in the
    **Plugins** tab.

## Usage ##

The **File > Recently Closed** sub-menu contains the list of
recently-closed files. To reopen one of these files, select the
corresponding menu item.

<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd> will also reopen the most
recently closed file.
